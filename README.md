  <h1 align="center">UCP Python SDK</h1>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <b>Official Python library for the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP).</b>
</p>

## Overview

This repository contains the Python SDK for the
[Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)](https://ucp.dev). It provides Pydantic
models for UCP schemas, making it easy to build UCP-compliant applications in
Python.

## Installation

For now, you can install the SDK using the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Universal-Commerce-Protocol/python-sdk.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd python-sdk

# Install dependencies (requires uv and just)
just install
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

This project uses `uv` for dependency management, and `just` as a command runner.
Ensure you have high-level tools available to build the developer environment smoothly:

- [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- [Install just](https://just.systems/man/en/)

You can see all available developer commands by running:

```bash
just
```

### Generating Pydantic Models

The models are automatically generated from the JSON schemas in the UCP
Specification.

To regenerate the models to the latest schema:

```bash
```bash
just generate
```

To regenerate the models targeting a specific schema version (for example, "2026-01-23"):

```bash
just generate 2026-01-23
```
If no version is specified, the `main` branch of the
[UCP repo](https://github.com/Universal-Commerce-Protocol/ucp) will be used.

The generated code is automatically formatted using `ruff` via the `just` hook.
